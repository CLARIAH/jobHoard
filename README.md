# jobHoard: an occupational 'gazetteer'

Many research projects in the humanities and social sciences uncover mentions of occupations from sources such as archived documents and surveys. In spirit of the [World Historical Gazetteer](http://whgazetteer.org), the worlds largest time aware gazetteer, jobHoard aims to be a finding place for those mentions as well as the projects that uncovered them. Moreover, jobHoard provides important characteristics of those occupations as various projects also take effort to standardize the occupational strings and code them into international classifications, such as HISCO, OCC1950, and ISCO, and provide them with rankings such as ISEI, HISCAM, SIOPS, SOCPO, EGP, HISCLASS. 


# Contribute and make your research FAIR
Please consider contributing your occupational titles to jobHoard, so other may benefit from your coding efforts, like your efforts are likely to have relied on theirs. Also make your project more findable as we will provide links to your project. Contributions are accepted in a lightweight or proper format.

# Light weight format (CSV or spreadsheet)
The light weight format **MUST** contain the following variables:

- url of the project from which occupation are derived;


# Proper format (CSV UTF-8)
As the light weight format, but also containg:
- the occupation's standard classification equivalent, such as HISCO or ISCO;
- peristent identifier directing to the project's url.
